# Metal-Mapper

A project for MCR Codes coding bootcamp by Sophie Ashcroft, Helena Nicholson, and Kirsty Devlin

## What is Metal-Mapper

Metal-mapper is a web app that helps metal fans discover pubs and music venues in the new places they visit.

## How did Metal-Mapper start

Metal-Mapper was created to demonstrate the development skills of the founding team. 

Helena is a metal music fan who travels inter/nationally to see metal bands play, when she arrives in a new city before the show she's always looking for a friendly metal-themed pub her and her friends can hang out in. The one resource she's been using is now broken, and there is no way for her to quickly and simply find metal pubs.

Using Facebook's Graph API Metal-Mapper will display a list of metal pubs based on geographical location.
