# Metal-Mapper

A project for MCR Codes coding bootcamp by Sophie Ashcroft, Helena Nicholson, and Kirsty Devlin

## What is Metal-Mapper

Metal-mapper is a web app that helps metal fans discover pubs and music venues in the new places they visit.

## How did Metal-Mapper start

Metal-Mapper was created to demonstrate the development skills of the founding team. 

Helena is a metal music fan who travels inter/nationally to see metal bands play, when she arrives in a new city before the show she's always looking for a friendly metal-themed pub her and her friends can hang out in. The one resource she's been using is now broken, and there is no way for her to quickly and simply find metal pubs.

Using Facebook's Graph API Metal-Mapper will display a list of metal pubs based on geographical location.

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### Start up the application:

```bash
npm start
```

### Visit `localhost:8080` in your browser.

You should see a **Hello World** message.

### Change the rendered output

You can change what is mounted to the DOM in `src/index.jsx`. 

It might be a good idea to make an `App` component inside `App.jsx` (will likely handle your layout and routing), and to mount this to the DOM.

### Pushing Commits - Branches

# 1. Create new working Branch 
In our attempt to keep in line with best practices for version control, we should always aim to be working on a seperate branch and merge into master individually. No-one should be working on master. If you get stuck don't hesitate to reach out.

# 2. Assign member of team to Review code and approve -

# 3. Once all changes on branch have been approved, merge branch with master and delete the branch

git checkout - will return you back to master branch
